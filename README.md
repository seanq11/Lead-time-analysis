The code reads an excel file that contains mock information about a company usiing an agile approach to software development.
The information about code tickets and has information about when it was created, when it was started, when it was completed, the work item the ticket was about, 
the state of the ticket (done, refinement etc), which team was working on the ticket, and which application the ticket was working on.
The code then plots this information into a bar graph that shows lead and cycle time per application by team as well as a line graph
that shows each ticket by its date completed and its lead time by team.

IMPORTANT
The line graph shows after the bar graph is exited
